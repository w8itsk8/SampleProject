# SampleProject

This project accepts an input of a list of sold items and creates a list of each item and the number of times that item appears in the list. The program then prompts the user with a menu where they can choose to enter a single item and see its frequency, view the full list of items and frequencies, or view a chart of all items and their frequencies.
I found creating the menu and option functions to be especially easy and fun! I'm glad to feel so comfortable with this material. I think those will really come in handy during more advanced coding classes.
I definitely felt less comfortable importing and exporting files and creating the map. I'm sure the code for those could be more efficient. My code also does not handle errors and won't function if any of the items have a multi-word name. W3 codes really helped me understand maps while programming.
Clarity is the best asset of this program. Even a non-coder could examine my code and, due to informative variable names and efficient code, understand what my program does.
